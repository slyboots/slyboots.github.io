- fact: I am married to a wonderful, artistic racoon named Michelle.
- fact: I have two hairy babies. Their names are Whisp and Pan.
- fact: I am colorblind (protanomaly). But that's okay because most of my clothes are black!
- fact: My goal in life is to work hard, and make lots of money, so I can give my cats the life they deserve.
- fact: I'm not really much of a designer (even disregarding the colorblindness). I just like to poke at things and automate stuff.
