So I'm going to be finishing some projects a little out of order.

Project number 3 (a keyboard controller) ended up being possible to do in vanilla javascript, but not without a __lot__ of leg work.

So I've found a react and holy crap. It's such a straightforward library.
I'm super late to this party, I know. I was stubbornly avoiding it, and I regret fighting it now.

anywho. Next week I'll have that keyboard element up. For this week the dummyimage.com cli I made for python will have to do.
