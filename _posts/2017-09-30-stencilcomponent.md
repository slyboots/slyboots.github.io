# So #

I've already had a pretty productive weekend.

### Stuff done:
- Made some small edits to this site's CSS
- Wrote a small python cli using argparse that downloads images from dummyimage.com
- I have a very ugly non-functional keyboard!!!

### Things I've come to realize:
- Writing up a million things from scratch is no fun.
- I'm not going to do stuff from scratch anymore. Libraries are useful

### Things I've... Thought:
- I wanna play with Stenciljs (webcomponents)
- I wanna learn more about events (angular made events so easy)
