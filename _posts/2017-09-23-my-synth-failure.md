### I am a crappy designer... ###
I technically finished a project last week. (*see: [Synth](https://github.com/slyboots/1-simplesynth "Slyboots Synth"){:target="_blank"}*)  
It just wasn't __much__ of a project. *(see: [poop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poop "Poop"){:target="_blank"})*

My simple synth project ended up being a stupidly ugly barely functional non enjoyable piece of junk. It makes sound though...  
I didn't start this with the intent to make something absolutely amazing every single week.
Mainly, I just wanted to give myself some sort of objective so I would have a purpose, and not end up with a library of spaghetti snippets.

But still, I wasn't very satisfied with that week. I realized that I had no clue how data binding actually works, or how to implement it myself in a clean, and friendly way.
Not having databinding kinda killed a lot of my momentum. *Angular made it so easy :/*  

I also realized that I suck at CSS. __How the hell do you make a rotary knob in CSS?__ I found a bunch of codepen examples, but nothing that was really what I wanted or that fit what I had in mind.
Also, it wasn't explicitly stated in my mission statement that I wouldn't use a framework for any of these projects, but I am sorta avoiding them.
When I used angular it was always annoying finding the exact thing I wanted but it was in a library called: *react-circular-knobs*  

Great! Now I can spend a day trying to port it! Yay! */s*

If I make a library or a tool, I want it to be framework agnostic. Just plug and play.

I don't mind using something like [Tachyons](tachyons.io) (*which you'll see a lot of*) because its unopinionated, and really just a shortcut to individual CSS styles I would be applying myself anyways.

Anywho, with all this being typed, and a few holes in my webdev skill now being painfully obvious:  
My next project will be a set of UI components ready to be databound.
I'll start out simple. Just a few core ui things and then some behind the scenes things...


#### idea list: ####
- button (ui)
- button groups (ui)
- switch (ui)
- slider (ui)
- keyboard input (behind the scenes)
- mouse input (behind the scenes)
